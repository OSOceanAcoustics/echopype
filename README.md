# echopype
Open source tools for unpacking and analyzing active sonar data.

# What?
What do people use right now to read/process echosounder data?
- EchoView (commercial) [EchoView R](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR)
- LSSS (Norway)
- [ESP3](https://bitbucket.org/echoanalysis/esp3/overview) (NZ, open source in Matlab, yoann.ladroit@niwa.co.nz)
- [Echo metric](https://github.com/ElOceanografo/EchoMetrics)
  - need an echogram as input
- [Echogram](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/echogram/index.html)(read HAC format)
- [Movies](http://flotte.ifremer.fr/fleet/Presentation-of-the-fleet/Logiciels-embarques/MOVIES): ifremer, read HAC format
- [Movies3D](http://flotte.ifremer.fr/content/download/6032/129677/file/MOVIES3D_general.pdf): join EK60 and ME70 data, create HAC
- MSS? from DFO, cannot find links

# So What?
- Be able to read data from the OOI arrays (AZFP and EK60)
- Explore ways to view and process data using Python
- Convert manufacturer proprietary formats to netCDF files following [ICES sonar-netCDF4 convention](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341/CRR341.pdf)


# Now What?
