echopype
===========

echopype is a package built for enhancing the interoperability and scalability
in ocean sonar data processing.
These data are widely used for obtaining information about the distribution and
abundance of marine animals, such as fish and krill.
Our ability to collect large volumes of sonar data from a variety of
ocean platforms has grown significantly in the last decade.
However, most of the new data remain under-utilized.
echopype aims to address the root cause of this problem - the lack of
interoperable data format and scalable analysis workflows that adapt well
with increasing data volume - by providing open-source tools as entry points for
scientists to make discovery using these new data.

See the `echopype documentation`_ for more detail.

.. _echopype documentation: https://echopype.readthedocs.io


Functionality
----------------
echopype include tools for:

- Converting different manufacturer-specifc data files into an interoperable
  netCDF format.

- Processing large volumes of sonar data in local or cloud storage by leveraging
  Python distributed computing libraries.

The current version supports file conversion for the ``.raw`` data files
collected by the SimRad EK60 echosounder. Conversion for other types of data
files, including the ``.01A`` files from AZFP echosounder, the ``.raw`` files
from the SimRad broadband EK80 echosounder, and the *raw beam* data from ADCP
(Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) will be added in future releases.


Installation
--------------

To install echopype, do the following in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install echopype


Using echopype
-------------------

File conversion
+++++++++++++++++++

To batch convert ``.raw`` files to the interoperable netCDF format in the
terminal, do:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echopype_converter -s ek60 data/*.raw

This will generate corresponding ``.nc`` files with the same leading
filename as the original ``.raw`` files in the same directory.

To use the EK60 data converter in a Python session, you can do:

.. code-block:: python

    # import as part of a submodule
    from echopype.convert import ConvertEK60
    data_tmp = ConvertEK60('FILENAME.raw')
    data_tmp.raw2nc()

Or:

.. code-block:: python

    # import the full module
    import echopype as ep
    data_tmp = ep.convert.ConvertEK60('FILENAME.raw')
    data_tmp.raw2nc()

Same as in the command line case, this will generate a ``FILENAME.nc``
in the same directory as ``FILENAME.raw``.

The ``ConvertEK60`` instance contains all the data unpacked from the
.raw file, so it is a good idea to clear it from memory once done with
conversion.


Data analysis
+++++++++++++++++++

The data analysis functionalites of echopype is being developed actively.
echopype currently supports:

- calibration and echo-integration to obtain volume backscattering strength (Sv)
  from the power data collected by EK60.

- simple noise removal by suppressing data points below an adaptively estimated
  noise floor [1]_.

- binning and averaging to obtain mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS)
  from the calibrated data.

The steps of performing these analysis are summarized below:

.. code-block:: python

    from echopype.model import EchoData
    data = EchoData('FILENAME.nc')
    data.calibrate()  # Calibration and echo-integration
    data.remove_noise(save=True)  # Save denoised Sv to FILENAME_Sv_clean.nc
    data.get_MVBS(save=True)  # Save MVBS to FILENAME_MVBS.nc

Note that by default, method ``calibrate`` save the calibrated volume
backscattering strength (Sv) to ``FILENAME_Sv.nc``, while method ``remove_noise``
and ``get_MVBS`` by default do not generate new files. The computation results
from these two methods can be accessed from ``data.Sv_clean`` and ``data.MVBS``
as xarray DataSets. All outputs are xarray DataSets with proper dimension
labeling.
