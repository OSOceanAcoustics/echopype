Echopype
========

Echopype is a package built for enhancing the interoperability and scalability
in ocean sonar data processing.
These data are widely used for obtaining information about the distribution and
abundance of marine animals, such as fish and krill.
Our ability to collect large volumes of sonar data from a variety of
ocean platforms has grown significantly in the last decade.
However, most of the new data remain under-utilized.
echopype aims to address the root cause of this problem - the lack of
interoperable data format and scalable analysis workflows that adapt well
with increasing data volume - by providing open-source tools as entry points for
scientists to make discovery using these new data.


Functionality
-------------

Echopype currently supports file conversion and computation of data produced by:

- ``.raw`` files generated by Simrad's EK60 echosounder
- ``.raw`` files generated by Simrad's EK80 echosounder (alpha)
- ``.01A`` files generated by ASL Environmental Sciences' AZFP echosounder

The file conversion functionality converts data from manufacturer-specific
binary formats into standardized netCDF or zarr files, based on which all
subsequent computations are performed.
Data processing routines currently include calibration (instrument-specific),
noise removal, and mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) calculation
for narrowband echoes. EK80 calibration based on pulse compression output
in the form of average over frequency is implemented.

.. note::
   EK80 ``.raw`` conversion is now for alpha testing.
   We know the current implementation raises error when encountering data
   recorded using the 2-in-1 transducer
   (see `#145 <https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues/145>`_ and
   `#146 <https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/pull/146>`_ ).
   Please report any bugs by raising issues on GitHub.
   Pull requests are always welcome!



Installation
------------

Echopype can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install echopype

or through conda:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge echopype


When creating an conda environment to work with echopype,
use the supplied ``environment.yml`` or do

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda create -c conda-forge -n echopype python=3.8 --file requirements.txt


Usage
-----
