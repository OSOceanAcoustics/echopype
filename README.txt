===========

echopype is an open-source tool for converting and processing active sonar data for biological information in the ocean. The goal is to create a toolkit that can leverage the rapidly-developing Python distributed processing libraries and interface with both local and cloud storage.

This is an ongoing project and the first stage (current) development goals are:
1. Conversion of data from 3 sonar manufacturer-specific file formats into a common file format to enhance sonar data interoperability.
2. Basic data processing functionalities that operate on the common data format.

Details of the above can be found on `here <https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype>`_.
