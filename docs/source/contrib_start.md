# Contributing to Echopype

We welcome your contributions, large or small!

Contributions are NOT limited to code -- bug/warning reports, new feature requests, or usage questions are all very helpful for improving the software.


## Bug reports, feature requests, questions
Please ask report bugs or request new features via GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues).

## Contribute to code and documentation
We use the fork-branch-pull request (PR) workflow to add new code into Echopype.
