# Types of contributions

We welcome your contributions, large or small!

Contributions are NOT limited to code -- bug/warning reports, new feature requests, or usage questions are all very helpful for improving the software.


## Bug reports, feature requests, questions
Please ask report bugs or request new features via GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype/issues).
If you're new to GitHub, checking out these tips for [creating issues on GitHub](https://medium.com/nyc-planning-digital/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f).


## Contribute to code and documentation
We use the fork-branch-pull request (PR) workflow to add new code into Echopype.
If you are new to this workflow, check out this [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/forks-and-pull-requests-how-to-contribute-to-github-repos-8843fac34ce8).
