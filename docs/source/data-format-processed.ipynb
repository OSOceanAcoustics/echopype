    "Part of the calibration operation is to compute a new data variable `echo_range`, which is the physically meaningful range (in meters) of the echo samples, from the `range_sample` dimension in the raw data. Recall that `range_sample` are 0-based indices of the digitized sample numbers of the received echoes. This computation requires knowledge of the sound speed, so that the sampling interval (the variable `sample_interval` in `EchoData[\"Beam_groupX\"]`) can be converted to distance along range in meters, i.e.. like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta r = c \\tau / 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    ", where $\\Delta r$ is the along-range \"length\" of each sample, $\\tau$ is the `sample_interval`, and $c$ is sound speed. The factor 2 is due to the round-trip travel from the transmitter to the scatterer and back to the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `sample_interval` can be different for each echosounder frequency channel, the resulting ``echo_range`` can be different across frequency channels even if they have the same number of digitized samples. This can be seen in the diagram below."
