    "The calibration operation includes the computation of a new data variable, `echo_range`, which is the physically meaningful range (in meters) of the echo samples, from the `range_sample` dimension in the raw data. Recall that `range_sample` contains 0-based indices of the digitized sample numbers of the received echoes. This computation requires knowledge of the sound speed, so that the sampling interval (the variable `sample_interval` in a `Sonar/Beam_groupX` group) can be converted to distance along range in meters, i.e. like below:\n",
