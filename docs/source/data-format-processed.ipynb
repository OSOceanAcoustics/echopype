    "which is the physically meaningful range (in meters) of the echo samples, from\n",
    "the ``range_sample`` dimension in the raw data.\n",

    "of the received echoes.\n",
    "This computation requires knowledge of the sound speed, so that the digitization\n",

    "can be converted to distance along range in meters.\n",

    "Because ``sample_interval`` can be different for each echosounder frequency channel,\n",
    "the resulting ``echo_range`` can be different across frequency channels even if\n",
