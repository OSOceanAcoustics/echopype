    "The diversity of raw data file formats generated by different sonar systems is a major obstacle toward integrative analysis of ocean sonar data at large scales. Echopype aims at addressing this problem by providing tools for converting data in manufacturer-specific formats into a standardized [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_introduction.html) data model, so that data from different instruments are interoperable. NetCDF is the [current defacto standard](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/courses/parallel_python/02_xarray_zarr.html) in climate research and is supported by many powerful Python packages for efficient computation, of which echopype take advantage extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The section [Raw converted data](data-format:raw-data) details how echopype handles and represents data unpacked and standardized from the raw files generated by the sonar instruments. Echopype follows the [ICES SONAR-netCDF4 convention ver.1](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341.pdf) when possible to create interoperable data. See [echopype-specific modifications](data-format:mod-to-sonart-netcdf4) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The section [Processed data](data-format:processed-data) provides information for the format of derived data products, such as the calibrated Sv data."
