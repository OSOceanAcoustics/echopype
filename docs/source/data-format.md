# Interoperable data formats

The diversity of raw data file formats generated by different sonar systems is a major obstacle toward integrative analysis of ocean sonar data at large scales. Echopype addresses this problem by providing tools for converting and standardizing data from manufacturer-specific formats into the **[netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) data model**, so that data from different instruments are interoperable. NetCDF is the [current defacto standard](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/courses/parallel_python/02_xarray_zarr.html) in climate research and is supported by many powerful Python packages for efficient computation, of which echopype takes advantage extensively.

The section [**Adaptation of SONAR-netCDF4 convention**](data-format:sonarnetcdf4-adaptation) details echopype's adaptation of the [ICES SONAR-netCDF4 convention version 1](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341.pdf) to create standardized data that fully leverage the power of label-aware manipulation and enhance coherence of data representation for scientific echosounders.

The section [**Raw converted data**](data-format:raw-data) provides instrument-specific examples on raw data unpacked and organized ("converted" via [](echopype.open_raw)) into standardized `EchoData` objects.
