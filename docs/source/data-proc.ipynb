    "Echopype data processing funcionalities are structured into different subpackages with a series of [data processing levels](processing-levels) in mind. Once the data is converted from the raw instrument data files to standardized [`EchoData` objects](data-format:echodata-object) (or stored in `.zarr` or `.nc` format) and calibrated, the core input and output of most subsequent functions are standard [xarray `Dataset` objects](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html). This way, additonal processing functions can be easily added without needing to understand specialized objects."

    "- [`calibrate`](echopype.calibrate): Transform raw instrument data into physicaly meaningful quantities, such as the volume backscattering strength (Sv)\n",
    "  - Narrowband Sv:\n",
    "    AZFP, EK60, and EK80 narrowband (\"CW\") mode transmission\n",
    "  - Broadband Sv average over the signal frequency band: EK80 broadband (\"FM\") mode transmission  \n",
    "- [`consolidate`](echopype.consolidate): Add additional information such as the geospatial locations, split-beam angle, etc to calibrated datasets. The source of information include:\n",
    "  - Data already stored in the `EchoData` object, and hence already stored in the raw instrument data files\n",
    "  - Quantities that can be computed from data stored in the `EchoData` object, e.g., for EK80 broadband data, split-beam angle can be computed from the complex samples\n",
    "  - External dataset, e.g., AZFP echosounders do not record geospatial data, but typically there is a companion dataset with GPS information\n",
    "- [`clean`](echopype.clean): Reduce variabilities in backscatter data by perform noise removal operations. Currently contains only a simple noise removal function implementing the algorithm in {cite}`DeRobertis2007_noise`.\n",
    "- [`commongrid`](echopype.commongrid): Enhance the spatial and temporal coherence of data. Currently contain functions to compute mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) and nautical areal backscattering coefficients (NASC) that both result in gridded data at uniform spatial and temporal intervals.\n",
    "- [`qc`](echopype.qc): Handle unexpected irregularities in the data. Currently contains only functions to handle timestamp reversal in EK60/EK80 raw data.\n",
    "- [`mask`](echopype.mask): Create or apply mask to segment data\n",
    "- [`metrics`](echopype.metrics): Calculate simple summary statistics from data\n",
