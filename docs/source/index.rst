Welcome to echopype!
====================

**Echopype** is a package built for enhancing the interoperability and scalability
in ocean sonar data processing.
These data are widely used for obtaining information about the distribution and
abundance of marine animals, such as fish and krill.
Our ability to collect large volumes of sonar data from a variety of
ocean platforms has grown significantly in the last decade.
However, most of the new data remain under-utilized.
echopype aims to address the root cause of this problem - the lack of
interoperable data format and scalable analysis workflows that adapt well
with increasing data volume - by providing open-source tools as entry points for
scientists to make discovery using these new data.
