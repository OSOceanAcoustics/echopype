Installation and Examples
=========================


Installation
------------

Echopype is available and tested for Python>=3.9. The latest release
can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/echopype/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install echopype

or through conda from the `conda-forge Anaconda channel <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/echopype>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge echopype

.. attention::
   We recommend using the ``libmamba`` solver instead of the classic solver.
   See instructions `here <https://conda.github.io/conda-libmamba-solver/getting-started/>`_
   for installation and usage.

Previous releases are also available on PyPI and conda.

For instructions on installing a development version of echopype,
see the :doc:`contributing` page.


Examples
--------

Additional `Jupyter notebooks <https://osoceanacoustics.github.io/echopype-examples/>`_
illustrating the workflow of Echopype are also made available. These
examples include a quick tour of Echopype, a demonstration of how Echopype can be used
to explore ship echosounder data from a Pacific Hake survey, and using Echopype to
visualize the response of zooplankton to a solar eclipse.
