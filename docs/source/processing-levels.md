# Proposed Echosounder Data Proccesing Levels (DRAFT)

The decades-long experience from the satellite remote sensing community has shown that a set of robust and well-articulated definitions of "data processing levels" [1]–[5] can lead directly to broad and highly productive use of data. Processing level designations also provide important context for data interpretation [6]. However, no such community agreement exists for active acoustic data. The ambiguity associated with the interoperability and inter-comparability of processed sonar data products has hindered efficient collaboration and integrative use of the rapidly growing data archive across research institutions and agencies.

The `echopype` team is developing a clearly defined progression of data processing levels for active ocean sonar data. The development leverages the collective experience from remote sensing and large-scale, long-term ocean and ecological observatories [7]–[10]. Data processing functions in `echopype` are clearly associated with specific Processing Level inputs and outputs, and when appropriate, will generate a `processing_level` dataset global attribute with entries such as "Level 1A", "Level 2B", "Level 4", etc.


## Processing Levels and Sub-levels

### Level 0 (L0)

**Description:**  Raw data in vendor sensor format.

- raw binary files. Associated metadata may be found in external files.

### Level 1 (L1)

**Description:** Raw data packaged with ancillary information and converted and standardized to an open convention and standard data formats. May be distributed in the following two forms:
  - as sets of individual converted files as originally segmented into arbitrary time ranges during sensor file creation, or
  - compiled into larger granules corresponding to logical deployment intervals.

- **L1A**: Raw L0 data converted to a standardized, open format with geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude) included. Includes other ancillary information extracted from sensor-generated L0 data or other external sources. May include environmental information such as temperature, salinity and pressure. Use of the SONAR-netcDF4 v1 convention is strongly recommended.
- **L1B**: L1A data with quality-control steps applied, such as time-coordinate corrections that enforce strictly increasing, non-duplicate timestamps.

### Level 2 (L2)

**Description:** Calibrated acoustic quantities at raw data resolution, with spatial coordinates included (latitude, longitude and depth)

- **L2A**: Volume backscattering strength (`Sv`) with interpolated latitude, longitude and depth coordinates. May incorporate addition information, such as  split beam angle
- **L2B**: `Sv` L2A data with noise removal or other data filtering applied, including seafloor bottom removal.

### Level 3 (L3)

**Description:** Calibrated acoustic quantities regridded or aggregated to a common grid across channels. May include noise removal or other filtering.

- `Sv` resampled to a common, high-resolution grid across channels
- Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (`MVBS`)
- Masks applied to `Sv` based on different scattering source classification criteria and methods, such as frequency difference across two channels.
- **L3A**: The above variables computed on L2A data
- **L3B**: The above variables computed on L2B (filtered) data

### Level 4 (L4)

**Description:** Acoustically derived biological features, involving further processing of L3 data that may include data reduction or incorporation of external sources of data.

- Nautical Area Backscattering Coefficients (`NASC`), potentially partitioned into inferred sources of scattering
- Summary statistics of echogram features (center_of_mass, dispersion, etc)
- Taxon or species-level data labels (classification). May originate from a variety of methods, including frequency difference thresholds.
- Estimated biomass, combined or partitioned into different taxonomic sources.
