Below is a list of software resources for processing ocean sonar data.
When appropriate, we note whether the software is proprietary or open-source,
as well as the programming language in which language it is written.

- `EchoView <https://www.echoview.com/>`_: GUI-based proprietary software,
  current go-to tool for echosounder data analysis

  - `EchoView R <https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR>`_:
    interfacing R and EchoView,
    related `paper <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/
