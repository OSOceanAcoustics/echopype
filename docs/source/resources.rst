Below is a list of software resources for processing ocean sonar data.
When appropriate, we note whether the software is proprietary or open-source,
as well as the programming language in which it is written.

  current go-to tool for echosounder data analysis

- `EchoView R <https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/EchoviewR>`_:
  interfacing R and EchoView, related `paper <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2015.00015/full>`_

- `Echogram <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=echogram>`_: an R package for
