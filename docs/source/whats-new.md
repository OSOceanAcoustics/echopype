# v0.6.0 (2022 May 26)

## Overview
This is a major release that contains changes that enhances the compliance of echopype data model (and hence generated file structure) to the [SONAR-netCDF4 convention Version 1.0 ](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341.pdf). In addition, some variables were renamed to improve intuitive understanding of sonar data, provenance and standardized attributes are added to the processed dataset (e.g. Sv), the deprecated old API (<0.5.0) was removed, and some bugs were fixed.

## Changes of netCDF data model

- Move and rename the original `Beam` and `Beam_power` group to be subgroups under the `Sonar` group, in order to comply with the structure defined in the convention  (#567, #574, #605, #606, #611)
  - `Beam` --> `Sonar/Beam_group1`: contains either raw power or power/angle data for all sonar models other than EK80. For EK80, if only complex or power/angle data exist, all data are in this group; if _both_ complex and power/angle data exist, the complex data are in this group.
  - `Beam_power` --> `Sonar/Beam_group2`: contains power/angle when complex data occupies `Sonar/Beam_group1`; only exists for EK80 data when _both_ power/angle data and complex data bothexist in the file
- Rename the coordinate `range_bin` to `range_sample` to make it obvious that this coordinate indicates the digitization sample number for the sound waveform or intensity time series, and hence it takes a form of sequential integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... (#595)
- Rename the data variable `range` in the calibrated Sv or TS dataset to `echo_range`, so that it is not confused with the python built-in function (#590)
- Rename the coordinate `quadrant` for EK80 data to `beam` (#619)
- Add coordinate `beam` with length 1 for all sonar models, except for AD2CP (#638, #646)
- Rename the data variable `Sp` to `TS` since "point backscattering strength" is a Simrad terminology and target strength (TS) is clearly defined and widely used. (#615)
- Rename time dimensions in the `Platform` group (`location_time`: `time1`, `mru_time`: `time2`) (#518, #631, #647)
- Rename the coordinate `frequency` to `channel` for all groups, to be more flexible (can accommodate channels with identical frequencies #490) and reasonable (since for broadband data the channel frequency is only nominal #566) (#657)
- Rename the data variable `heave` to `vertical_offset` in the Platform group (#592, #623)
- Change `src_filenames` string attribute to `source_filenames` list-of-strings variable (#620, #621)
- Bring consistency to the names of the time coordinates for the `Platform` and `Environment groups` (#656, #672)

## Changes of `EchoData` group access pattern

- The groups can now be accessed via a path in the form `echodata["Sonar/Platform"]`, `echodata["Sonar/Platform"]`, `echodata["Sonar/Beam_groupX"]`, etc. using [DataTree v0.0.4](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree/tree/0.0.4) functionalities. (#611)
- The previous access pattern `echodata.platform`, `echodata.sonar`, `echodata.beam`, etc. is deprecated and will be removed in v0.6.1.

## Addition of attributes and variables in raw-converted and processed data

- Add indexing info for `Beam_groupX` as data variable under the `Sonar` group (#658)
- Add missing coordinate and variable attributes in the processed datasets Sv, MVBS, TS(#594)
- Add `water_level` to processed datasets (Sv, MVBS, TS) for convenient downstream conversion to depth (#259, #583, #615)
- Add additional environment variables for EK80 data (#616)
- Add missing platform data variables (#592, #631, #649, #654)

## New features and other enhancements

- Add parser for Echoview ECS file (#510)
- Add provenance to raw-converted and processed datasets (#621)
- Consolidate convention specs into a single yml file for pre-loading when creating `EchoData` objects (#565)
- Extra visualization module can now handle both `frequency` and `channel` filtering, as well as files with duplicated frequencies (#660)
- Improve selection of Vendor-specific calibration parameters for narrowband EK data (#697)

## CI improvements

- Upgrade python minimum to 3.8 and tidy up packaging (#604, #608, #609)
- Upgrade echopype development status to Beta (#610)
- Update `setup-services.py` to include images & volumes subtleties (#651)

#v0.5.0 (2021 May 17)

## Overview

This major release includes:

- major API updates to provide a more coherent data access pattern
- restructuring of subpackages and classes to allow better maintenance and future expansion
- reorganization of documentation, which also documents the API changes
- overhaul and improvements of CI, including removing the use of Git LFS to store test data
- new features
- bug fixes


## API updates

The existing API for converting files from raw instrument formats to a standardized format, and for calibrating data and performing operations such as binned averages and noise removal has been updated.

The new API uses a new ``EchoData`` object to encapsulate all data and metadata related to/parsed from a raw instrument data file. Beyond the calibration of backscatter quantities, other processing functions follow a consistent form to take an xarray Dataset as input argument and returns another xarray Dataset as output.

The major changes include:

- change from an object-oriented method calls to functional calls for file conversion (using the new ``convert`` subpackage), and deprecate the previous ``Convert`` class for handling file parsing and conversion
- deprecate the previous ``Process`` class, which use object-oriented method calls for performing both calibration and data processing
- separate out calibration functions to a new ``calibrate`` subpackage
- separate out noise removal and data reduction functions to a new ``preprocess`` subpackage
- create a new ``EchoData`` object class that encapsulates all raw data and metadata from instrument data files, regardless of whether the data is being parsed directly from the raw binary instrument files (returned by the new function ``open_raw``) or being read from an already converted file (returned by the new function ``open_converted``)


## Subpackage and class restructuring

The subpackages and classes were restructured to improve modularity that will help will future expansion and maintenance. The major restructuring includes:
("SONAR" below is used to indicate the sonar model, such as EK60, EK80 or AZFP)

- consolidate overlapping EK60/EK80 components, deprecate the previous ``Convert`` classes that handled file parsing and serialization, and revise new ``ParseSONAR`` and ``SetGroupsSONAR`` classes for file parsing and serialization
- consolidate all calibration-related components to a new ``calibrate`` submodule, which uses ``CalibrateSONAR`` classes under the hood
- consolidate all preprocessing functions into a a new ``preprocess`` submodule, which will be later expanded to include other functions with similar use in a workflow


## CI overhaul and improvements

- Added github workflows for testing, building test docker images, and publishing directly to PyPI
- Deprecated usage of Travis CI
- Test run is now selective on Github, to run tests only on changed/added files. Or run all locally with ``run-test.py`` script. (#280, #302)


## Documentation reorganization and updates

- Re-organization of pages with better grouping
- Added "What's New" page
- Added "Contributing to echopype" page
- Overhaul "API reference" page


## New features

- Add interfacing capability to read from and write to cloud object storage directly. (#216, #240)
- Allow environmental and calibration parameters to be optionally used in calibration in place of the values stored in data file
- Mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) can now be computed based on actual time interval (specified in seconds) and range (specified in meters) (#54)
- Add NMEA message type as a data variable in the ``Platform`` group (#232), which allows users to freely select the suitable ones depending on use
- Add support to convert ``.ad2cp`` files generated by Nortek's Signature series ADCP (#326)


## Bug fixes

- Fix EK80 config XML parsing problem for files containing either ``PulseDuration`` or ``PulseLength`` (#305)
- Fix time encoding discrepancy in AZFP conversion (#328)
- Fix problematic automatic encoding of AZFP frequency (previously as ``int``) to ``float64`` (#309)
- Overhaul EK80 pulse compressed calibration (current implementation remaining in beta, see #308)


# v0.4.1 (2020 Oct 20)

Patches and enhancements to file conversion

This minor release includes the following changes:

## Bug fixes

- Fix bug in top level .nc output when combining multiple AZPF `.01A` files
- Correct time stamp for `.raw` MRU data to be from the MRU datagram, instead of those from the RAW3 datagrams (although they are identical from the test files we have).
- Remove unused parameter `sa_correction` from broadband `.raw` files
- Make sure import statement works on Google colab

## Enhancements

- Parse Simrad EK80 config XML correctly for data generated by WBAT and WBT Mini, and those involving the 2-in-1 "combi" transducer
- Parse Simrad `.raw` files with `NME1` datagram, such as files generated by the Simrad EA640 echosounder
- Handle missing or partially valid GPS data in `.raw` files by padding with NaN
- Handle missing MRU data in `.raw` files by padding with NaN
- Parse `.raw` filename with postfix beyond HHMMSS
- Allow export EK80 XML configuration datagram as a separate XML file

## Notes

To increase maintenance efficiency and code readability we are refactoring the `convert` and `process` modules. Some usage of these modules will change in the next major release.


# v0.4.0 (2020 Jun 24)

Add EK80 conversion, rename subpackage model to process

## New features

- Add EK80 support:

  - File conversion from EK80 `.raw` files to netCDF and zarr formats
  - "Simple" calibration to frequency-average Sv based on pulse compression output is implemented but needs to be thoroughly tested.

- Rename subpackage `echopype.model` to `echopype.process`

  - The new name better describes the subpackage's function to process data for further analysis
  - Also rename class `EchoData` to `Process` to mirror the structure in `Convert` better.
  - Importing using the old names will be deprecated in the next release.

- Overhaul converting multiple files with `combine_opt=True`

  - If target format is netCDF, temporary files will be created and finally combined to a single netCDF. This is due to current restriction that xarray does not allow simply appending new data to an existing file.
  - If target format is zarr, data in each file are unpacked and appended to the same output file.

- Allow reading Zarr into `Process` in addition to netCDF: thanks @lsetiawan!

- Add a logo!

## Bug fixes

Fix bugs in slicing NMEA group data based on the same time base when `range_bin` is changed
