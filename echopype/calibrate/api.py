def compute_Sv(echodata: EchoData, **kwargs) -> xr.Dataset:
    """
    Compute volume backscattering strength (Sv) from raw data.

    The calibration routine varies depending on the sonar type.
    Currently this operation is supported for the following ``sonar_model``:
    EK60, AZFP, EK80 (see Notes below for detail).

    Parameters
    ----------
    echodata : EchoData
        An `EchoData` object created by using `open_raw` or `open_converted`

    env_params : dict
        Environmental parameters needed for calibration.
        Users can supply `"sound speed"` and `"absorption"` directly,
        or specify other variables that can be used to compute them,
        including `"temperature"`, `"salinity"`, and `"pressure"`.

        For EK60 and EK80 echosounders, by default echopype uses
        environmental variables stored in the data files.
        For AZFP echosounder, all environmental parameters need to be supplied.
        AZFP echosounders typically are equipped with an internal temperature
        sensor, and some are equipped with a pressure sensor, but automatically
        using these pressure data is not currently supported.

    cal_params : dict
        Intrument-dependent calibration parameters.

        - for EK60 echosounder, allowed parameters include:
          `"sa_correction"`, `"gain_correction"`, `"equivalent_beam_angle"`
        - for AZFP echosounder, allowed parameters include:
          `"EL"`, `"DS"`, `"TVR"`, `"VTX"`, `"equivalent_beam_angle"`, `"Sv_offset"`

        Passing in calibration parameters for other echosounders
        are not currently supported

    waveform_mode : {"CW", "BB"}, optional
        Type of transmit waveform.
        Required only for data from the EK80 echosounder.

        - `"CW"` for narrowband transmission,
          returned echoes recorded either as complex or power/angle samples
        - `"BB"` for broadband transmission,
          returned echoes recorded as complex samples

    encode_mode : {"complex", "power"}, optional
        Type of encoded return echo data.
        Required only for data from the EK80 echosounder.

        - `"complex"` for complex samples
        - `"power"` for power/angle samples, only allowed when
          the echosounder is configured for narrowband transmission

    Returns
    -------
    xr.Dataset
        The calibrated Sp dataset, including calibration parameters
        and environmental variables used in the calibration operations.

    Notes
    -----
    The EK80 echosounder can be configured to transmit
    either broadband (``waveform_mode="BB"``)
    or narrowband (``waveform_mode="CW"``) signals.
    When transmitting in broadband mode, the returned echoes are
    encoded as complex samples (``encode_mode="complex"``).
    When transmitting in narrowband mode, the returned echoes can be encoded
    either as complex samples (``encode_mode="complex"``)
    or as power/angle combinations (``encode_mode="power"``) in a format
    similar to those recorded by EK60 echosounders.

    The current calibration implemented for EK80 broadband complex data
    uses band-integrated Sv with the gain computed at the center frequency
    of the transmit signal.
