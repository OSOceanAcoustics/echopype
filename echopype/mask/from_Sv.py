    """
    Create a mask based on the difference of Sv from a pair of frequencies.

    This method is often referred to as the "frequency-differencing" or "dB-differencing" method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    da : xr.DataArray
        A DataArray containing the Sv data to create a mask for
    freq_pair
        The pair of nominal frequencies to be used for frequency-differencing
    del_Sv_min and del_Sv_max:
        The minimum and maximum thresholds of Sv difference between frequencies.
        ``del_Sv`` is the difference of the Sv at the higher frequency
        minus the Sv at the lower frequency.

    Returns
    -------
    A DataArray containing the mask.
    Regions satisfying the thresholding criteria are filled with 1s,
    with all other areas filled with 0s.
